    Infinite 3D Zoom
    ----------------

	This is just a dressed up version of a basic cube zooming animation.
    The animation portion was pretty straight forward, so took no time at
    all. However, I spent way too long dressing it up to a stage where I
    was only mildy satisfied with the result. The original had a nicer 
    reflective pass, but I couldn't afford to use it... You can't win them 
    all, but if you like drab brown-looking one pass scenes, then you'll 
    love this. :D Oh well, post and move on, as they say. :)
    
    For those not familiar with the infinite zoom illusion, it's a pretty
    simple concept: In the 2D sense, you produce a miniscule object then 
    expand its size to some maximum before snapping it back to its original
    minimum size (the fract funciton does that). On its own, it's not very
    illusory, however, if you do the same with multiple objects at various 
    stages in the expansion process, your mind gets tricked into believing 
    that a camera is zooming toward the central object -- In reality, the 
    camera is effectively stationary. This particular example is just a 3D 
    extension on the aforementioned with various tweaks.
    
    Anyway, there are better zoom examples than this on Shadertoy, so if
    that kind of thing interests you, search "infinite zoom" or something 
    along those lines. I have some 2D zooming animations that I might post
    at a later date.
