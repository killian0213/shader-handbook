/*
	Apollonian Structure
	--------------------

	Overall, there's nothing particularly exciting about this shader, but I've 
	always liked this structure, and thought it'd lend itself well to the two 
	tweet environment.

	I couldn't afford shadows, AO, etc, so applied a bit of fakery to at least
	convey that feel.
