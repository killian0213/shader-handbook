    Extruded Semi-regular Tiling
    ----------------------------    

    A while ago, after looking at Fizzer's "Wythoff Uniform Tilings + Duals" example, I 
    got curious as to what one of the semi-regular tilings would look like in extruded
    form. The variation I chose was a 3.4.6.4 semi-regular tessellation, which is formed 
    using a triangle, square and regular hexagon. I like it because it resembles 
    overlapping dodecahedrons. I'm not sure if the configuration has a special name, but 
    it's very common.
    
    Raymarching extruded grid tiles in realtime requires more planning and trickery than 
    their 2D counterparts. Luckily, the variation I chose came together fairly easily. 
    The extruded heightfield in planar form was kind of interesting, but a little 
    underwhelming, so I decided to jazz it up a bit by using a few cheap demoscene 
    cliches -- Warped space, cheap transparent tubes to emulate light rays, etc.
    
    I had the cathedral scene from Farbrausch's "fr-08, .the .product" 64k demo in the 
    back of my mind, when making this, for anyone who still remembers that. This is the 
    geometric alien chamber version... It's a very loose connection. :)
    
    As an aside, I went searching for examples of extruded semi-regular pattern imagery 
    and found none, which surprised me, since extruded regular prismatic square, hexagon, 
    etc, and simple variations are commonplace amongst the Blender, stock imagery crowd, 
    and so forth. Semi-regular variations are a natural extension of the aforementioned,
    so I figured it'd be a common thing. There are probably examples out there, but it
    was clear that the graphics crowd haven't adopted the more interesting variations yet.
    
    Anyway, for anyone ever in need of one of these, here's the code. I've explained the 
    general process inside the distance function. I'll leave the cell by cell traversal 
    as an exercise for the reader. :)
