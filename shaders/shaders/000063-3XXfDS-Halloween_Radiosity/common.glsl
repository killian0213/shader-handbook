    Overview:
    This is a fairly straightforward ray-casting renderer, which uses irradiance 
    data computed in the first few frames as part of its lighting calculations. 
    The weirdest part is probably the way the cutout shapes are handled.

    Ray marching is used for the pumpkin and stalk shapes. The ray marcher uses 
    2nd-order information (directional derivatives) to help avoid distortion or 
    noise at edges and allow using functions that aren't quite SDFs. This is 
    practical because the functions are relatively simple, with cheap partial 
    derivatives. Having partial derivatives also makes computing surface normals 
    trivial.

    The cutout shapes also use ray marching, but it is performed in 2D instead of 
    3D, after projecting the 3D ray into 2D using a transformation similar to 
    perspective projection. This transformation gives lines at the corners that 
    radiate out from the center of the pumpkin. The shapes are vector data that 
    was prepared in advance. I think I probably *could* have implemented ray 
    marching of these shapes just using shader code, but there are a lot of line 
    segments (over 200 in total!) and I decided to encode the shapes compactly 
    (using 8-bit coordinate values) and expand them into a grid of cells that can 
    be traversed during ray marching.
    
    The cutout ray marching is currently slower than I expected on integrated
    graphics (maybe spilling some variables to memory?). I think I need to try
    refactoring it into separate steps for distance to closest point on edge
    (for antialiasing/masking) and ray marching (only when necessary).

    Indirect illumination outside the pumpkins is computed (during the first 12 
    frames) using the classical radiosity approach, but I am extending it 
    slightly by storing irradiance for three different directions (three surface 
    normals) for the pumpkin shapes so the ridges on the pumpkins can be lit 
    convincingly. This directional data is only used during final rendering (not 
    during the radiosity passes). The radiosity passes also modify the irradiance 
    of source patches using a function of incident angle, to compensate for the 
    fact that the BRDFs of the surfaces are not Lambertian (it's not physically 
    accurate, but I think it's better than just assuming Lambertian reflection).

    The meshes used for the radiosity steps are mostly 16x16. Data for higher 
    resolution meshes is also computed for some surfaces, to be used in final 
    rendering. Direct light uses similar meshes, but more high resolution data is 
    computed because it is necessary to capture shadow edges. For some shadow 
    data, fractional occlusion data for four quadrants of the area light is 
    computed (but this is not used during radiosity passes). The meshes are 
    warped in various ways to optimize utilization of the points (e.g. putting 
    more points closer to the floor where there is a steep irradiance gradient).

    The pumpkins and stalks also use radiosity, and so they need meshes. uv 
    spheres and uv cylinders are mapped to the surfaces. Data for this mapping 
    (e.g. displacements and normal vectors, in the case of the pumpkins) is 
    precomputed. The latitude-longitude mapping works well due to the nature of 
    the surface functions that I'm using.

    Inside the pumpkins, the lighting is a bit more ad-hoc. I was trying to use 
    physically-based lighting where possible (the candles are point lights 
    though). The interior of the pumpkins is a very good diffuser of light, so 
    there isn't really any need for radiosity. I used spectral path tracing 
    offline to figure out the lighting, and I found some cheap approximating 
    functions for the shadows and ambient occlusion around the tea lights.

    The edges of the cutouts really need ambient occlusion to look good, and this 
    *is* computed by the shader using a combination of sampling 32 different 
    directions (to find "horizons") and approximating the unoccluded area as a 
    polygon whose light can be integrated analytically using a standard approach 
    from radiosity. I'm using the same AO data for ambient light from both 
    directions (outside and inside the pumpkin).

    The most difficult thing (which I did last) was computing the shadowing for 
    the direct light (from the big area light) shining on the cutout edges. This 
    is only visible in a few places (less than a quarter of the total length of 
    the cutout edges, I think). I initially tried to fake it, but I couldn't find 
    anything that looked good. Sampling the light at each point required too many 
    samples, and expensive ray marching. I finally figured out how to do it 
    analytically. This is cheap enough to do in real time, but still somewhat 
    expensive, so I found a way to precompute it during the first frame. It 
    requires taking a lot of samples to get information about the fraction of 
    light that is occluded, as a function of depth. This function is approximated 
    as Hermite splines, which can be encoded compactly. An advantage of the 
    Hermite spline representation is that it can be integrated cheaply, to help 
    anti-alias the shadow edges, although in the end I found that I could integrate
    over piecewise linear segments and it looked fine.

    BRDFs are fairly standard (using the typical "GGX" D and G functions for 
    specular) but I'm using exponents 3 or 4 instead of 5 in the F function (not 
    treating it as an actual Fresnel function approximation, but it should still 
    be physically plausible by construction), and using functions for the 
    diffuse part that improve energy conservation and reciprocity (a bit similar 
    to the Disney BRDF diffuse function, but not the same, and they are different 
    for each BRDF). There's no perfect solution for using non-Lambertian BRDFs
    with (non-directional) radiosity data, but I'm trying to do better than 
    just assuming Lambertian reflectance; the scaling functions were found by 
    Monte Carlo simulation and approximated with polynomials.

    The candles are probably my favorite thing. I didn't expect the animation to 
    work so well. If you let it run for a long time, they end up flickering too 
    much though (I assume it's a sin/cos precision issue but I haven't
    investigated yet).

    (I put some additional information at the beginning of the individual 
    shaders.)

    For computing form factor between differential area and polygon
    This is applied to pairs of adjacent vertices on the polygon and summed (similar to the "shoelace formula" for computing 2D polygon area)
    
    I derived this formula from information and formulas I found in Glassner's Principles of Digital Image Synthesis (page 920).
    
    Later I read Stephen Hill & Eric Heitz's slide show "Real-Time Area Lighting: a Journey from Research to Production".
    They use a different version of the formula (and a different geometrical interpretation perhaps) and say that it had originally
        been derived by Lambert (!)
    The use of atan instead of acos here seems to solve the precision issue (avoids having to implement a specialized approximation as they did).
