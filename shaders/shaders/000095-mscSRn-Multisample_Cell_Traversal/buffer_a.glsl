    Multisample Cell Traversal
    --------------------------
    
    I've often wondered why some of us, incuding myself, like that noisy path 
    traced aesthetic whilst others don't. I'm not sure why, but for me, I 
    associate noisy light based stuff with elite democoders from the past.

    Either way, I'd imagine virtually all of us prefer crisp clean path 
    traced imagery over the noisy ones. Unfortunately, the former is nearly
    impossible to achieve in realtime inside a pixelshader environment for 
    anything but the simplest of scenes.
    
    This particular example represents a compromise. The results wouldn't pass 
    the static imagery test, or the intersting scene test. :D However, it's 
    pretty good for something produced under realtime constraints. By the way, 
    I have an asymmetric quad traversal rendered in the same style that I'll 
    post pretty soon.
    
    In order to achieve this, I've performed a cell by cell hexagon traversal 
    and rendered just six samples with three bounces each. That amount of work 
    is not ideal, but an average machine should be able to handle it. Six 
    samples produces a pretty noisy result, so I've applied IQ's temporal 
    reprojection code to give the impression that there are eight times that, 
    so 48 samples in all -- The trade-off is some slight temporal blurring. 
    However, even that isn't quite enough to clean up the noise, so I've 
    included a denoising pass in Buffer B.
    
    Overall, the image isn't perfect, but it's not too bad for just a few 
    samples. The reason someone would go through all that trouble is a mixture
    of academic curiosity and to produce lighting in a scene that is not
    possible to recreate using more common realtime Blinn-Phong related 
    lighting methods.
