    Multisample Raycaster
    ---------------------
    
    This is a realtime path traced cell by cell square grid traversal. The scene 
    is lit entirely by rendered square emitters on the sides of the square prisms
    and a small portion of atmospheric haze. No Blinn-Phong was harmed during the 
    making of this shader. :D
    
    I've been meaning to post one of these for a while. Individually, all the 
    concepts involved are pretty simple. However, tying them all together involves 
    more thinking than I enjoy, so I've been procrastinating on it for a while. :)
    
    Since this is realtime path tracing, things aren't going to be perfect on an
    average system -- and apologies in advance for those with slower systems. A 
    basic static path traced scene normally takes seconds to minutes to produce in 
    a fast application like Blender, but realtime requirements only allow for a 
    fraction of a second per frame, so perfect quality is a big ask.
    
    Realtime path traced cell by cell traversals are not common, but they're 
    nothing new, and there's even a few examples on Shadertoy -- By the way, check 
    out 0b5vr's work on here, if you're into this kind of thing. A lot of realtime 
    path traced examples that have been appearing in demo competitions feel like 
    they're based on W23's "past racer by jetlag" engine, which is fair enough, as 
    it lends itself well to that kind of thing. This particular example was coded 
    off the top of my head, and uses simple traditional techniques that have been 
    around for ages. The grid traversal code is also standard and the very simple 
    emitter and throughput lighting code is as basic as it gets.
    
    As mentioned in other examples, the only genuinely interesting thing is the use 
    of IQ's temporal reprojection code. Under the right circumstances it can give 
    the appearance of a huge sample boost.
    
    In regard to scene design, there is none. It's a textured square grid with some 
    tiny colored squares painted on the sides and some dark edging. That's the 
    beauty of path traced light emitters. Once everything's in place, the algorithm 
    does a lot of the aesthetic work for you.

// Unfortunately, if you have a slow machine IQ's temporal reprojection option
// will usually result in blur. Regular accumulation might work, but you'll 
// probably have to use straight samples (BUFF_ACCUM 0).
// Buffer accumulation style:
// 0: No accumulation -- Noisy, sharper picture, but with no blur. 
// 1: Regular accumulation with no reprojection -- A mixture.
// 2: Temporal reprojection. -- Smoother for faster machines.
