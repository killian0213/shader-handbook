	Fast Cellular Blocks
	--------------------

	After looking at IQ and Aiekick's 2D Voronoi triangle-metric examples (the ones that 
	look like blocks), I thought it'd be interesting to raymarch the pattern onto a back 
	plane to see just how 3D it looked. The result was an interesting voxelized look with
	more depth than the regular, or bump mapped, examples you see around. After that, I 
	figured I'd add some variance by rounding things off, combining layers, etc, but ran 
	into speed problems.

	At that stage, I wondered whether the much faster cellular tiled approach could emulate 
	the pattern, and thankfully, it could. I came up with the layered repeat-tile approach 
    a while back, and have explained it in other examples. The result, here, is an 
	artifact-free, animated triangle metric at a small fraction of the cost.

    Unlike my other cellular tiled examples, this one is animated. It was a proof of concept, 
	which was put in as an afterthought, so probably needs some tuning. Nevertheless, it
	works well enough for the purpose of this demonstration.

	At best, a normal animated Voronoi algorithm utilizing the triangle metric would have 
	nine iterations (many use more) consisting of several operations. The algorithm used 
	here uses just four, each with a fraction of the operations.

	I haven't utilized the speed to its full potential. However, there are still two 
	raymarched layers - each containing a more expensive distance metric - and my slowest 
	computer can handle it easily. I'll do something more interesting with it later.

	By the way, I made a very basic example with very little code for anyone who'd like to
	look at the algorithm without having to sift through a bunch of window dressing. The
	link is below.
