	Simplex Truchet Tubing
	----------------------

	This was inspired by Mattz's "Rainbow Sphaghetti" example, which I've always admired
	for both its aesthetics and mathematical content. However, this version was constructed
	via a more direct simplex grid approach. In fact, I made it a point not to look at 
	Mattz's code too deeply in the hope that I might bring something new to the table... 
	Not sure if I did, but here it is anyway. :)

	The idea is very simple: Break space into a simplex grid, which is just a bunch of 
	packed regular tetrahedrons. Each tetrahedron has four faces, so run a tube from one
	face center to another face center, then do the same with the remaining two faces - 
	If you require a visual reference, look up cubic Truchet tiles, then picture one with
	tetrahedrons instead of cubes. The result is a grid space full of double-tubed 
	tetrahedral Truchet blocks which can each be randomly oriented to produce a Truchet 
	pattern.

	Running a straight tube, or even a Bezier curve, from one tetrahedral face center to 
	the next is almost trivial, but threading tori through them was slighly more tricky. 
	Each had to be centered on the correct central edge, then aligned accordingly. The code 
	to do that turned out to be reasonably simple, but I had to make a lot of really stupid 
	mistakes to get there. :)

	Anyway, for anyone interested, the relevant code is contained in the distance function;
	The rest is window dressing. I also have a much, much more simplistic version using 
	straight tubes that I'll put up pretty soon which should be much easier to absorb. With
	a bit of trial and error, I've also managed to produce an animated version, so I'll
	put that up too.
	

	By the way, I really rushed in the comments, but I'll tidy them up later.
