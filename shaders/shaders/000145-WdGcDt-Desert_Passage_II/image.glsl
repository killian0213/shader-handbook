	Desert Passage II
	-----------------

	Encoding precalculated functions into the cube map faces to create a rocky landscape 
    tunnel flythrough. This has been sitting in my account for a while, but I was too lazy
	to tidy the code up and post it until now. :)

    To be honest, I find wrapped texture precalculation, packing and subsequent unpacking a
	little on the laborious side, so I wouldn't expect anyone to want to try to sift through
	the code in order to decipher it. Regardless, this is just a proof of concept to show
    that it's possible to encode more interesting surfaces (2D or 3D) into textures for 
    realtime use.

    The surfaces themselves are just layers of 3D Voronoi and noise, which are pretty easy 
    to produce, but prohibitively expensive to construct on the fly in realtime. The sand
    pattern comes from another example of mine.

	Encoding 3D information into textures isn't new, and has been performed by myself and 
	others on Shadertoy a few times. This version is unique in the sense that neighboring
	values are packed into all four channels in order to reduce the total number of texture
	calls required for smooth interpolation -- Down from 8 to 2, which is obviously quicker.
	However, as mentioned previously, how well your machine handles this will depend on its
	ability to deal with textures in memory and other things.

	My machine can almost run this in fullscreen at full efficiency. However, if you have a 
    system that doesn't enjoy this, I apologize in advance, but will add that texture
	precalculation is still worth the effort.
