	Rounded Voronoi Blocks
	----------------------

    Applying some bump mapping and lighting to a Voronoi variation to produce an 
	animated, pseudo-lit, rounded block effect.

	I had originally intended to do a standard square block version using a first order
    triangular distance metric, but noticed that IQ, Aeikick and others had already done 
	it, so I switched to a second order distance setup and experimented with a few different 
	metrics. The end result was the oddly distributed round-looking blocks with defined 
	edges you see.

	To add a little more to the illusion, I bump mapped it, put in some fake occlusion,
	and some subtle edging. As you can see, there's not a lot of code.
