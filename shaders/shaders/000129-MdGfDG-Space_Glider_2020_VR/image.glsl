 *
 *
 * How to fly
 * ----------
 *
 *	The simulated plane is a blend between an F16 and a Space Shuttle.
 *	Full throttle gives a thrust-to-weight ratio of 130%.
 *
 *	Reference speeds:
 *
 *		Speed is shown in the HMD in m/s relative the selected frame of reference.
 *		This is either true ground speed (in surface mode) or inertial speed
 *		(in orbit mode). The following reference speeds (at sea level) can be
 *		given for atmospheric flight.
 *
 *			stall speed				40 m/s
 *			landing speed			60 m/s .. 70 m/s
 *			best glide speed		89 m/s
 *
 *		Airspeed would be measured by a pitot tube as a function of dynamic
 *		pressure. Below is a table to compare Q (in bars) to equivalent air
 *		speed (in knots):
 *
 *			Q		 EAS	Q		 EAS	Q		 EAS	Q		 EAS
 *			------------	------------	------------	------------
 *			0.01	  80	0.06	 190	0.20	 350	0.58	 600
 *			0.02	 110	0.08	 220	0.26	 400	0.68	 650
 *			0.03	 140	0.10	 250	0.33	 450	0.79	 700
 *			0.04	 160	0.12	 270	0.41	 500	0.91	 750
 *			0.05	 175	0.15	 300	0.49	 550	1.04	 800
 *
 *	Taking off:
 *
 *		Gentle (like an airliner)			Scramble (like a fighter)
 *
 *		- Trim 2.5%, flaps 2 notches		- Trim neutral, flaps 1 notch
 *		- Throttle to 35%					- Throttle to 70%
 *
 *		For all cases
 *
 *		- Accelerate to 75 m/s
 *		- Bring the nose up *gently* (repeated tap on keyboard is enough)
 *		- Retract gears immediately
 *		- Retract flaps when climb is stable
 *		- Manually adjust trim as you go, or select the fly-by-wire controller
 *
 *	Cruise:
 *
 *		During cruise it is recommended to select the fly-by-wire controller,
 *		as this will relief you from the workload of manual trim management.
 *		Below are some examples of the kind of settings to expect.
 *
 *						speed	alt		(=Q)	throttle	trim
 *
 *			Bonanza		  90	 3.5 k	0.03		 9		  9
 *			Airliner	 250	11.5 k	0.11		15		  1.5
 *			Concorde	 600	18 k	0.24		45		  0
 *			SR-71		1000	24 k	0.25		48		  0.5
 *			X-15		2000	50 k	0.03		 9		 15
 *
 *		The exact settings for throttle and trim depend on the local air den-
 *		sity which varies with temperature. The settings for the last two lines
 *		were determined for prograde/eastwards direction. Other flight direct-
 *		ions will require different settings since the interaction with the
 *		planet rotation is not negligible.
 *		Another curved surface effect is the coriolis force that will induce
 *		a clockwise or anti-clockwise turn resp. on the northern or southern
 *		hemispheres.
 *
 *	Landing:
 *
 *		The goal is to come in on a 5% glide slope, or about 3 degrees.
 *		There is a tick on the pitch ladder at this postition for convenience.
 *		The safe limit to deploy gears should be Q < 0.1, but this is not
 *		checked yet. Below is a table with suggested settings, assuming gears
 *		down and full flaps.
 *
 *			landing
 *			speed		throttle	trim	(= alpha)
 *
 *				55		12.0		21.0	12.9
 *				60		 9.5		15.0	 9.7
 *				65		 9.0		12.0	 7.9
 *				70		 8.5		 8.5	 5.6
 *
 *		The ground effect will help you cushion the impact a bit, but for the
 *		best landings you need to intervene manually to flare out. The vertical
 *		speed at touchdown then determines your rating:
 *
 *			0 .. 2 m/s		excellent
 *			2 .. 4 m/s		normal
 *			4 .. 6 m/s		hard landing
 *			6 and above		crash landing
 *
 *	Gliding with maximum range:
 *
 *		The highest L/D-ratio this aircraft can make is near 8.9 but the
 *      exact value depends Reynolds number, Mach number, etc.
 *		At sea level, the best glide is achieved in the following condition:
 *
 *			required trim setting					5.5%
 *			 = angle of attack (alpha)				4.0°
 *			 = dyn pressure (Q)						0.04 bars
 *			 = speed at sea level					83 m/s
 *
 *      There are 2 gliding challenges located at start points M and U.
 *      Both expect you to reach the waypoint and land without engine power.
 *      Select engine-off mode to start rolling downhill.
 *
 *      Tips for challenge 1 at start point M:
 *      - Trim to 25% initially, turn to 90° while rolling and aim for the 'gap'
 *      - Retract gears as soon as airborne and keep the nose at the horizon
 *      - Pitch down (press down arrow) while rolling to avoid hopping
 *
 *      Tips for challenge 2 at start point U:
 *      - Trim to 15% initially and aim for the 'bump', otherwise same as above
 *      - Turn right to 120° and accelerate to over 90 m/s to clear the obstacles
 *      - Approach the runway with full flaps at 80 m/s
 *
 *	Thrust vectoring:
 *
 *		The thrust vector can be rotated on a ladder of fixed positions from
 *		0 degrees (prograde), via 36, 60, 75, 84, 90 (downward), 105, 120, 144
 *		to 180 degrees (retrograde). This allows VTOL maneuvers, hovering or
 *		flying like a helicopter, and also rapid decelerations.
 *		The control key for thrust vector rotation depends on the browser.
 *
 *			Firefox		'key-next-to-the-left-shift-key'	` or <
 *			Chrome		'key-below-the-esc-key'				~ or °
 *
 *		Pressing this key alone moves the ladder backwards towards 0 degrees,
 *      and together with shift moves the ladder forwards towards 180 degrees.
 *		The throttle for hovering is around 76% (depending on latitude).
 *
 *
 * How to space
 * ------------
 *
 *	Going into orbit:
 *
 *		The safe altitude for a stable orbit in this simulation is 150 km.
 *		Below this altitude (more precisely, when Q > 0.5 µbar) the atmospheric
 *		drag is taken into account and the orbit will slowly decay.
 *		The required orbital speed at 150 km altitude is 2861 m/s.
 *		If timed well, the entire ascent procedure could be done in less than 500s.
 *		For example, when taking off eastward from startpoint B, orbital
 *		insertion can be achieved before crossing over water.
 *
 *		(1) Accelerate upward
 *
 *		At the surface:
 *		- Turn eastwards
 *		- Full throttle
 *		- Maintain a recommended climb angle around 75°
 *
 *		At 30 km altitude:
 *		- If fly-by-wire control was active, return to manual
 *		- Enable RCS with rate control
 *		- Switch info page to orbit info
 *		- Switch HMD to orbit mode
 *		- Keep an eye on the vertical velocity on the HMD
 *
 *		(2) Gravity Turn
 *
 *		Approaching 700 m/s vertical velocity:
 *		- Gently pitch down and follow the the dashed 'hover line'
 *		- Hold vertical velocity approximately constant at 700 m/s
 *		- You can make small corrections by aiming above and below the line
 *		- Keep an eye on the apoapsis ('Ap') value on the orbit info page
 *
 *		(3) Accelerate forward
 *
 *		Approaching 150 km apoapsis ('Ap'):
 *		- Gently pitch down below the horizon and follow the '+Pe' symbol
 *		- Hold apoapsis ('Ap') constant at 150 km
 *		- You can make small corrections by aiming above and below the symbol
 *
 *		From this point onward there are 2 possibilites:
 *
 *		(3a) You reach orbital speed (2861 m/s) before reaching 150 km altitude.
 *		(3b) You reach 150 km altitude before reaching orbital speed.
 *
 * 		Which destiny you are headed can be seen from the theta angle.
 *      If theta is increasing towards 180°, you're on path 3b (good),
 *		otherwise, you're likely on path 3a (not good).
 *
 *      Therefore:
 *		- Keep an eye on the 'theta' value on the orbit info page
 *      - If theta is no longer increasing (3a), reduce throttle until it is.
 *      - If theta crosses 180° (3b), pitch up to hold altitude until insertion.
 *
 *		(4) Orbital insertion:
 *
 *		When 'Pe' and 'Ap' are equal:
 *		- Press space for engine cut off
 *		- Switch RCS to LVLH mode to keep aligned with the orbital rotation
 *		- Congratulations, and enjoy the view!
 *
 *	Unpowered Re-entry from orbit:
 *
 *		This procedure mimics the unpowered re-entry in Space Shuttle style.
 *		It requires a bit less than half an orbit to complete so you will end up
 *      on the opposite side of the planet from where you started out.
 *      It will take about 1700s from de-orbit to touchdown.
 *		Start point A is conveniently located to immediately make the de-orbit
 *      maneuver for a landing at point C.
 *
 *		(1) Prepare de-orbit
 *
 *		- Align with the flight path
 *		- Switch to waypoint info
 *		- Wait until distance to target is about 2500 km
 *
 *		(2) De-orbit
 *
 *		- Switch to orbit info
 *		- Maximum reverse thrust to lower the periapsis down to the surface (0 km)
 *
 *		(3) Prepare re-entry
 *
 *		- Pitch up to 35 degrees
 *		- Activate aero direct manual control
 *		- Trim up to 100%
 *		- Engage spoilers
 *		- Wait until contact with the sensible atmosphere at about 80 km altitude
 *
 *      (4) Re-entry
 *
 *      Re-entry is divided into a temperature phase and a G-force phase.
 *      Throughout both phasees the descent rate is controlled by the bank angle.
 *      In order to not stray off course, you need to reverse left/right bank from
 *      time to time.
 *
 *		(4a) Re-entry phase 1: Temperature control phase
 *
 *		- Switch HMD to surface mode
 *		- Switch to temperature info
 *		- Keep an eye on vertical speed
 *      - When vertical speed approaches -100 m/s roll 80° to the side
 *      ---> Use both roll and yaw controls to make a nice coordinated roll
 *      - Aim for -50 m/s vertical speed
 *      - If temperature raises too quickly, reduce vertical speed even more
 *      - To make it a challenge, try to keep the heating below 65 kW/m²
 *
 *		(4b) Re-entry phase 2: Deceleration control phase
 *
 *      - Below 60 km altitude the peak heating should be over
 *      - Aim for -80 m/s vertical speed
 *		- Keep an eye on the G-load
 *		- When G-load approces 1 g, reduce pitch trim keep it near 1 g
 *      - Continue until the speed approaches Mach 3
 *
 *		(5) Terminal glide
 *
 *		- Level out and trim out
 *		- You should be around Mach 3 at 30 km altitude and close to your target
 *		- Turn off RCS mode
 *      - Switch to waypoint info
 *		- Keep vertical speed at around -80 m/s
 *		- Overfly the target runway
 *		- wait for 'Δh' to read half the value of 'dst' in the waypoint info panel
 *		- Make a turn back to the runway and glide to land

	- minor tweaks (colors, optical densities, phase functions, ocean reflection, dyngamma)

changes v41:

	- add shot noise simulation in low light levels
	- add color preservation logic to tone mapper
	- add canopy color filter (aids comparison with real world images taken from inside a cockpit)
	- add numpad keys for viewing
	- fix NaN terrain normals when height reaches limit exactly (happens on seafloor)
	- fix shadow contact angle from hardcoded constant to actual apparent sun size
	- minor change of cockpit/HUD

changes v40:

	Flight dynamics model
	- add ground effect
	- add Cnb90, Clb90 coeffs, gives wing rocking effect at high AoA
	- add rarefaction effects based on Knudsen number
	- correct induced drag computation, this changes max L/D ratio, moved gliding challenge accordingly
	- revise fly-by-wire control law to also be somewhat useful underwater

	Refactorings in preparation for multiple celestial bodies
	- remove hardcoded terrain sampler locations
	- move hardcoded terrain colors into data tables
	- move hardcoded cloud parameters into data tables

	Others
	- fix oversteering tendency in input handler for low FPS
	- add TRN_SAFE_SLOPE config
	- minor change to gamut remapping
	- remove 'zoom' text when magnification is active
	- remove KIOSK mode
	- remove IMG_BLACKLEVEL

TODOs:

	multiple celestial bodies
	- change local planet index at sphere-of-influence boundaries
	- check missed ray against other celestial bodies (only sphere impact)
	- render terrains of multiple planets in buffer B
	- update localplanetindex and orbitplanetindex in gamestate at transition distances
	- fix render bug at high planet distances

	performance
	- precompute cloud tau50Z as function of h and n2 (5 ms in 1080p)

	bugs
	- light adaptation is lost after map view
	- marker position is not initialized properly (garbage value)

	atmosphere
	- move AMTL_CORRECTION into data
	- water vapor content dependent on local temperature
	- seasonal variation of cloud patterns
	- decreasing effective molecular mass in thermospheric altitudes?

	ocean
	- ocean color (chlorophyll content) dependent on local temperature (and depth)

	vehicle controls
	- add automatic flaps mode
	- add autothrottle modes
	- add tracking targets to RCS modes
	- add wheel steering (nws) switch on/off

	flight dynamics
	- add ability to do spinning
		* aoa-dependent loss of directional and lateral stability
	- add more mach effects
		* delayed onset of mach drag divergence due to wing sweep
		* mach tuck
