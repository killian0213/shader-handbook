Only 10 Raymarch Steps! Other looks can be found with as few as 5 steps.
This shader was influenced by Xor's Surf 2, but created using a different technique.
Xor's Surf 2: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3fKSzc
Methods were drawn from my Abstract Series: https://www.shadertoy.com/playlist/D3VBDt
In this series, I aimed for creativity with low raymarch count volumetrics.
Many looks can be found with a few adjustments but the low ray march count makes it tricky and interesting.
One of the challenges is creating depth with the lower raymarch count. 
Accumulated glow/HDR is reduced. Less steps are taken along z and the distance along z is reduced.
Ways I added percieved depth here is through movement, turbulence, 
color contrast of background, volumetric glow, and color variation along length(p.xy).

Notes: 
Aces tonemap > Tanh for higher contrast look in this scene.
Dot noise - volume that we are moving through.
Clear Tunnel for "Camera": 2.-length(p.xy)
Turbulent Effect: s+=abs(sin(p.z)); - Movement along z creates turbulent effect
Color like "Luminence": 1.+sin(i))/s; - s gives glow and sin(i) gives iterative color for each raymarch 
Volumetrics: p+=d*s; Accumulate along each step of d
