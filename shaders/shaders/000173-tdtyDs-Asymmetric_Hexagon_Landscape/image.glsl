    Asymmetric Hexagon Landscape
    ----------------------------

	Just for fun, I coded up a landscape of extruded asymmetric hexagonal blocks 
    tailored to resemble randomly packed polygons. It's more of a proof of concept 
    than anything else. I think it runs well enough, and I've documented the code 
    to a certain degree, but I wouldn't take any of it too seriously. I had the 
    idea to do this when I was in Bavaria back in March, so that provided minor 
    inspiration for the design. It's rendered in an abstract low-poly cartoon style.

	The code was hastily put together with old projects and makes use of something
	I constructed in 2D a long time ago when attempting to produce a fast random 
    Delaunay pattern. The idea is simple in concept, since it's nothing more than a 
    grid of hexagons with offset vertices. The Delaunay pattern I was after turned 
    out to be less interesting than I'd hoped for, due to the restricted offsets 
    involved. However, I always figured it'd look pretty cool in extruded form. The 
    thing holding me back was the usual speed constraints. In fact, speed was not 
    the primarily concern, but rather the painful buffer setup and wrapping 
    considerations required to make it fast. By the way, apologies in advance for
	the longer compile time; I'll try to get that down later.

	Mattz and IQ have already posted some pretty cool hexagon related traversals,
	and I'm pretty sure Abje -- who puts together a lot of clever stuff that slips
	under the radar -- has already produced a Voronoi prism cell traverser, along 
    with a couple of other people. Fizzer's basically constructed every traversal 
    at one point or another, so I guess I'm saying that this isn't an entirely new 
    concept. Having said that, it is unique in the sense that it consists of 
    rounded asymmetric hexagons, plus it's a buffer-stored raymarched field that 
    can render pretty quickly... if you have a machine that works well reading 
    textures. I won't go as far as to say that it's an extruded straight edged 
    Voronoi grid, but it definitely has that kind of feel to it.
	
    There are too many possible improvements and enhancements to name. There are 
    provisions within the code for neighboring hexagon checks, which allows for all 
    kinds of features like bridges, stairs, etc, but of course that would add to 
    the complexity. Either way, I'd like to do something along those lines at some 
    stage. For anyone interested, I'll put up a simple version featuring just the
	offset hexagons soon.
