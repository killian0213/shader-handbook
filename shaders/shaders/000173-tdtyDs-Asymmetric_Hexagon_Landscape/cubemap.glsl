// A regular extruded block grid.
//
// The idea is very simple: Produce a normal grid full of packed objects.
// That is, use the grid cell's center pixel to obtain a height value (read in
// from a height map), then render a pylon at that height.

// For a 2D extruded block tiling four objects are needed. For the Cairo tiling,
// each block needs to be subdivided into two seperate pentagonal pieces, so 
// that's eight pentagon distances all up. Since there are no vec8 containers in 
// WebGL, we need to make one. By the way, for regular 2D Cairo tiles, you only 
// need four or even two, depending what you're trying to do.
