 * An aeons-old city is found within the frozen heart of Antarctica.
 * Inspired by the novella 'At the Mountains of Madness' by H.P. Lovecraft.
 *
 *     Buffer A: Scene rendering.
 *     Image: Scene sampling and antialiasing.

 * As with all of my shaders, part of this work is something old, part is
 * something new, and part is something borrowed. Oh, there is also some blue.
 *
 * [Terrain]
 *
 *     'Value Noise Derivatives' - iq
 *     https://iquilezles.org/articles/morenoise
 *
 *         This was my first go with this method of heightmap generation,
 *         so naturally iq's article on it was tremendously helpful.
 *
 * [Lighting]
 *
 *     'Outdoors Lighting' - iq
 *      https://iquilezles.org/articles/outdoorslighting
 *
 *         Second time using this lighting setup, and it works very well 
 *         for large, outdoor scenes.

 * [Volumetric Fog]

 *
 *     'Xyptonjtroz' - Nimitz

 *
 *         Though my final fog result is fairly different from theirs, they were
 *         still valuable resources. The Noise3D function is taken from Dave_Hoskins.
 *
 * [Pathing]
 *
 *     'Fourier vs Spline Interpolation' - revers
 *     https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MlGSz3
 *
 *         Used revers' Catmull-Rom implementation in the camera path interpolation.
 * 
 * [SDFs]

 * [Anti-Aliasing]
 *
 *     'Anti-Aliasing Compare' - JasonD
 *     https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dGXW1
 *
 *         Implemented '3Dfx rotated grid' in SampleAA().
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Known Issues / To-Do
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *     - Terrain 'warp' bubbles.
 *     - Fullscreen performance.
 *     - General refactoring.
 *     - City aliasing.
 *     - The sky is pretty plain.
 *     - A better title...
