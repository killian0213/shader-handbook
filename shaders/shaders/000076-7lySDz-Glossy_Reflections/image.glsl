    // means any pixels outside that are not rendered. On a 1980x1080
    // fullscreen resolution, this means roughly a quarter of the pixels
    // are rendered, which is a huge saving. Of course, this also means
    // that the scene needs to be upscaled, which will make things less
    // crisp, but you can't have everything. :)
